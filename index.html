            <h2>The Me-Mover story</h2>
            <p>
              The founder and chief designer of Me-Mover, the architect Jonas
              Eliasson, had become really tired of his long, inactive and boring
              commute. Combined with a running injury and an annoyance at not
              being able to exercise, Jonas began to consider how he could
              utilize the transportation time to exercise. It should be fun,
              efficient and easy to move.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jonas lived outside Stockholm and to get to work he used the
              metro. But Jonas lived a good distance from the nearest metro and
              therefore he spent a long time just reaching the station. Jonas
              was an avid in-line skater, but a previous injury, cobbled stone
              roads and the frequent Swedish summer rain made the trip either
              completely impossible or just unsafe. Bicycles were not a good
              alternative, as this was not particularly effective as
              rehabilitation or for exercise and otherwise was not allowed on
              the subway.
            </p>
            <p>
              This became the starting point for the idea of ​​Me-Mover: A means
              of transport that combined effective and gentle training. For many
              years the idea was rumored and at the end of 2008 Jonas decided to
              draw Me-Mover version 1.0.
            </p>

              src="img/black-memover.png"

              class="black-memover"
            />
            <h3>What is a Me-Mover?</h3>
            <p>
              Me-Mover Fit is a step bike that makes training and fitness a fun
              and exciting training experience. The technique itself only takes
              a few minutes to learn, and the ergonomic training movement
              activates 6 large muscle groups. Me-Mover was originally intended
              as a means of combining transport and effective training. But
              right from the start, Me-Mover received very positive reviews from
              users who had used Me-Mover to rehabilitate sports injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              People with chronic ailments, injuries and disabilities said that
              after becoming acquainted with Me-Mover, they could now start
              exercising again. There was also feedback from people who
              practiced sports at a professional level. They described that they
              had been able to increase their training volume by up to 15% per
              week. In elite sports, a few percentages or per mille are usually
              what you operate with. Therefore, Me-Mover initiated an experiment
              which was carried out by an internationally recognized test
              laboratory. The result showed that Me-Mover's shock load, even at
              the highest training intensity, is less than walking and thus is
              more gentle on the back and joints.
